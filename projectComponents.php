         Effective management and sustainable use of our reefs require up-to-date information and regular monitoring of their current conditions. With this in mind, the ARRAS technology was developed with the goal of recording and monitoring of the Philippines’ vast coral reefs. 
		 </p>
          <p style='font-size: 1.4em;'>
         The Automated Rapid Reef Assessment System (ARRAS) is a fast, diver-less, low-cost technology developed by UP Diliman and Mapua Institute of Technology that enables large-scale monitoring of coral reefs. This technology creates permanent visual records of Philippine reefs, and covers wide areas in a short amount of time. 
          </p>
          <p style='font-size: 1.4em;'>
         ARRAS consists of towpedo, teardrop, underwater camera, GPS logger/echosounder, and a stitching software that enables users to cover a wide extent of underwater habitats and create permanent visuals records of these habitats. ARRAS captures underwater image of benthic habitats while being towed using a motorized boat. Images captured are then processed, and stitched images are embedded in Google Earth.
          </p>
          <p style='font-size: 1.4em'>
          DENR-BMB and Regional Offices were trained and equipped with the ARRAS technologies, which they use to monitor our NIPAS sites.

            While ARRAS enables large-scale monitoring of our coral reefs, we also need accurate data at highly localized scales to precisely assess the impact of disturbance on reefs and track if our reefs are recovering or continuously declining.

			The CoRVA Coral Survey uses a combined Reef Check and GEF-CRTR protocol. This is a simple and fast method that provides basic but essential data on coral reef health. The Reef Check protocol includes the use of a transect line to measure distance and area and a plumb-line to determine a point sample location along the line, and makes use of indicator organisms and substrates. The Global Environment Fund - Coral Reef Targeted Research (GEF-CRTR) protocol (van Woesik et al., 2009) was used as standard for sampling design and methods and includes the use of a tetrapod with a digital camera for photo-documentation.

			 <p style='font-size: 1.4em'>
			 With this, we aim to map the distribution of coral communities in our NIPAS sites, and assess the current state of the coral reefs using commonly used metrics such as hard coral cover and biodiversity, and their vulnerability and resilience to threats such as coral bleaching. We also established a monitoring system for some of our NIPAS sites to allow the quantification of changes in the structure of these reefs, and allow for projections of future state based on various scenarios.

              Reef fish are some of the most highly prized, economically important species, and many Filipinos rely heavily on fisheries products for both food and livelihood. Fish populations have been steadily declining due to overexploitation and destructive human activities, and in order to understand the status and trends in reef fish populations, we need to assess and monitor key characteristics of fish assemblages in our NIPAS sites.
            </p>
            <p style='font-size: 1.4em'>
             Reef fish community assessment was conducted using a modified fish visual census (English et al., 1997). Community parameters collected were species richness, abundance, and biomass of reef fish assemblage in each station. Fishes within three 50 x 10 meter transect were identified, counted and estimated for their sizes. With this, we aim to assess the reef fish community structure and determine the current status of the NIPAS areas.

            <p style='font-size: 1.4em;'>Mesophotic ecosystems are extensions of shallow coral reefs that are located 30m-200m deep waters, where sunlight barely penetrates. Like shallow coral reefs, mesophotic reefs also harbour numerous coral species that are adapted to maximize light capture. Fish and other marine organisms also tend to be bigger and higher in number. </p>
           <p style='font-size: 1.4em;'>
             Deep coral reefs are potential refugia of marine organisms, as they are protected from fishing and other human activities. Mesophotic reefs are also foraging and spawning grounds, which makes them potential sources of larvae that can help rehabilitate degraded reefs.
            </p>
            <p style='font-size: 1.4em;'>
             With this, we aim to document the occurrence of corals in the mesophotic window (30-40m) in selected NIPAS sites, and also explore potential connectivity between the shallow reef and mesophotic depths.

             <p style='font-size: 1.4em;'>
           We used remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to capture images and video clips of corals, fish communities, and other benthic organisms. Bathymetric surveys were conducted using integrated GPS and single beam echosounders. Manual coral survey were also done in chosen dive sites that are within 30m-40 m water depths and at or close to a scarp. Corals that were encountered  were identified to genera level, while also identifying the associations of coral type with sea floor type and morphology.</p>

            Coastal zone is the interface where the land meets the ocean, encompassing shoreline  environments as well as adjacent coastal waters. Being a maritime nation with 18,000 km of shoreline, many Filipinos are heavily reliant on coastal resources for sustenance and income. Hence it is important to know how the coast is changing, and if there are risks to life and infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.4em;">
              With this, we aim to map and evaluate the current state of the shoreline and bathymetry near the shore, which can help us make initial inferences on the effect of current interventions being employed at these sites.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 1.4em;">
             The current state of the shore was evaluated using on site beach monitoring technique: walk-the-coast GPS survey that involves tracking the position of the shoreline by walking along the waterline and recording the position using a GPS receiver; and beach profiling by Emery Method for the measurement of the width and height of the beach and for tide correction. Historical shoreline and nearshore bathymetric changes were measured, and secondary data such as historical wind, typhoon, seismicity, rainfall, and tide were acquired to provide a better understanding on the erosion and accretion processes of the beach.

            Mangroves are trees, shrubs, or palms that are adapted to grow in the intertidal zone above mean sea level. These plants have evolved to survive such harsh environments by developing features such as high tolerance for salt, specialized prop roots and breathing roots, and waxy leaves that keep them from drying out. Mangroves offer a variety of ecosystem services, including habitat, spawning and nursery area of marine and even terrestrial organisms. They also sequester atmospheric carbon, export nutrients and organic materials, improve water quality by filtering sediments, and protect and stabilize coastlines.
            </p>
             <p style="font-size: 1.4em;">
               Mangrove forest of the Philippines have been continuously declining in the last century, mainly because mangroves areas are being converted to shrimp and fish ponds, while the wood are used as building materials and firewood. There is also very few research and conservation efforts, and lack of public awareness about the importance of mangroves.
             </p>
               <p style="font-size: 1.4em;">With this, we aim to assess the status of mangroves in our NIPAS sites, and evaluate mangrove community structure by conducting field surveys. Prior to field work, NAMRIA topographic maps (1950s) and recent satellite images were used to know historical and present extents of mangroves in these areas, and to select sites for ground truth. Along with these, we also held focus group discussions to know the perception of locals about habitat changes and issues. We also calculated vulnerability to erosion, inundation, and other causes of habitat change of the area is calculated.</p>

            <p style='font-size: 1.4em;'>Seagrasses are marine plants that, like terrestrial ones, have roots and flowers.Usually found in coastal areas with sandy to muddy bottoms, they need enough sunlight and a small amount of nutrients to  thrive. Seagrass beds provide food and shelter to and serve as breeding/nursery areas for numerous organisms, including shellfish and finfish. They also help protect coastlines from erosion and maintain water quality by acting as filters in areas where nutrient levels are too high.</p>
            <p style='font-size: 1.4em;'>Despite its importance, seagrasses are said to be the least studied the tropical coastal ecosystems. Seagrass communities are continuously threatened by decline in coastal water quality, reclamation and unregulated coastal development, degradation of environment and resources, and other human-induced disturbances.</p>

            Coral reefs, seagrass beds, mangroves, and other coastal habitats are patchily distributed throughout our seas; but all these habitats are interconnected because ocean currents carry and move nutrients, eggs, larvae, even organisms and pollutants among and between these reefs and other environments.

            <p style='font-size: 1.4em;'>
              Connectivity, or the flux of particles between and within protected areas is important because it helps maintain diversity and ecological resilience. With this, we aim to determine the connectivity of all the coral reefs of the Philippines using the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM; hycom.org) to simulate dispersal patterns for coral larvae. HYCOM is an ocean circulation model that optimally simulates coastal and open-ocean circulation features. Information from these models are important considerations in establishing MPAs and MPA networks in the area.
